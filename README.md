# Spam-Email Classifier
Spam email classifier is a project which is used to classify between spam emails and non- spam emails using Naiv Bayes Algorithm.
In email classification we import dataset and then apply data cleaning techniques and perform text processing techniques (vectorization of data) and then we will train our model on dataset provided.
The accuracy and precision of our model can also be predicted.
The comparison of KNN and Naiv Bayes will also be show to check which algoritm gives better performance of data
Web app of detection of spam email is also provided.
